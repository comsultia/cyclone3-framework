  <title>Extension ODFvalidator</title>

  <para>The purpose of this extension is to provide a validator, which
  developers and users can use to ensure the consistency and correctness of
  OpenDocument files. Original code writen by Alex Hudson as part of the
  <ulink
  url="http://www.opendocumentfellowship.org/development/projects/odftools">ODF
  Tools</ulink> project.</para>

  <para>The validator will list out any problems it finds with the file.
  Errors are fatal: these are problems where the file does not conform to the
  OpenDocument specification. Warnings are less fatal, but could indicate
  problems.</para>

  <para>Some of the errors will be somewhat inscrutable. You will probably not
  be able to fix them unless you're a developer.</para>

  <para>Look into <ulink
  url="?|?section=ext&amp;file=ODFvalidator/_init.pm">source code
  documentation</ulink>.</para>

    <title>Warning</title>

    <para>This is very much alpha software right now. It may warn or error on
    things which are valid OpenDocument; similarly, it may miss obvious
    problems with files. Let odf-devel know how you get on.</para>

    <title>Help Out</title>

    <para>Please let us know of any extra tests you think we can perform, new
